## Introduction

I wasn't quite sure what area of Computer Science I wanted to devote my time, attention, and energy to.
I have always known I had enjoyed games, Art, 3D, and most recently I have started exploring different web technologies.
After all its such a broad field. What aspect would be relevant for this.
After doing some journaling and note-taking I found that I enjoyed a variety of things Coding and Problem solving, Animation, Design, Compositing, Story Telling.
This is what led me to

<br />
<br />

## Roadmap

I found that at the core. I enjoyed using Code, Design, and Animation to build visually engaging, interactive, and immersive experiences on the Web, and so I am dedicating the year
of 2024 to explore this crevix of reality. I have plotted out a roadmap for what my learning through out the year would look like.
